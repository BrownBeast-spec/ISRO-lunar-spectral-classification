# ISRO-lunar-spectral-classification

ISRO hackathon project 2024, lunar hyper spectral classification using wavelet transformation

 - Abstracted and processed high-resolution IIRS Hyper-spectral image data from ISRO's Pradan platform for advanced lunar geological
 analysis.

 - Visualized and analyzed hyperspectral data using MATLAB,enabling clearer interpretation of spectral features.
 
 - Performed radiance to reflectance conversions and applied wavelet transformation for effective denoising of hyperspectral data.

 - Executed band normalization according to central wavelength for each band, enhancing data consistency across the spectrum.

 - Developed and trained spectral classification models using KNN, 1D CNN, and Gaussian Clustering, with successful GUI Implementation via MATLAB App Designer.
