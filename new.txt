The IIRS is the highest spectral and spatial resolution hyperspectral dataset of the Moon, available from Chandrayaan-2 mission. The data has immense use in understanding the Moonâ€™s geology. The data will be classified after categorising them based on similar spacecraft geometry to minimize the geometry-based effects. A well-covered region on the Moon will be selected for further analysis. The AI/ML tools will be used for quick spectral classification that can be further linked to mineral characterisation.
